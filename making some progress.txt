I'm making some progress here. My javascript to send json from the firefox scratchpad to a python bottle server shown at:

https://pastebin.com/tVDwjk4g

and the python is testing the rest api (seems like a fancy way of saying receiving json). 

https://pastebin.com/uGerTd6D

Firefox doesn't seem to like:

xhr.open("post", "http://127.0.0.1:8082/KSK/insert", true);

it upgrades the request to SSL and then I get the following SSL error:

https://pastebin.com/KbGvjyRf

I think I"ll either need to disable this firefox security policy / add a self signed certificate or more extreme a "self signed certificate authority". 

I need to do more research. Anyway, this javascript error is preventing me from testing the python code. My python code will insert some text into freenet via the pyFreenet package:

 I'm also testing asynchronous communication with the python code. In particular I"m using gevent/greenlet. This is the same asynchrony packages that is used by zeronet.

I'll discuss more about this later after some further troubleshooting.
